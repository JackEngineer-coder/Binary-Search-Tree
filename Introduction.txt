In Binary Serarch Tree we have conditon like that - The child of left hand side of each node have to be smaller than right hand side child of that node and also the element of left hand side of main root should not to be greater than root node, If that condition is true than you can say that it is a Binary Search tree.
In Binary Search tree recursion is work like laser guided missile because it's finding directly the desired element it cover the path like if element lesser to the node's element then you don't need to go to right in this case recursion go to the left side. if the desired data is greater then node's data then recursion will follow right hand side path and like that it directly hit to its target element.
That's why it's time complexity is log(n). it is very time efficient technique.
